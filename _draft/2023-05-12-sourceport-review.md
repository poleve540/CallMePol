title: My Thoughts on Various Doom Source Ports
categories: Doom
---
Ever since the original doom engine's source code was released to the public in 1993, hundreds of developers made their own improved source ports for the public. Source ports can enhance doom, add new features and even completely modify the game. But there are so many choices! Which is why I decided to make a list of the ones I love, and make a review for each one of them.

# Chocolate Doom (add choco logo)
Ever wanted to play Doom like it's 1993? Chocolate Doom, started in 2005 by Simon Howard, is a source port that aims to do exactly that.

Crunchy 4:3 resolution, 35 fps cap, and all the original game's bugs and limitations: Chocolate Doom is essentially indistinguishable from the vanilla executable. It is one of the most accurate source ports out there.

Despite the port's conservative nature, it still brings some new quality of life features. A modern control scheme, without the annoying vertical mouse movement. Controller support. Fullscreen support for higher resolutions, while still keeping the 320x200 look.
