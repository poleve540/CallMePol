MORE STUFF ABOUT THE TITLE SCREEN OF UNDERTALE 2 YAHOO!!

I was supposed to write about the intro cutscene, but when starting the game I discovered something new about the title screen. The music and main title can be randomised!

You have to get lucky to get one of these. There are 8 alternate titles:

 - Firsk Undertale: Und Attorney -- Revenge of the Robots
 - Under52
 - Undertale 3: Tickering Troupe Unite
 - Deltarune ZERO
 - Under Kong Taley 2: What Da Hecke
