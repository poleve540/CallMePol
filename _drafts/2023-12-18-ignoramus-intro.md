While there is no way to spare enemies in Undertale 2, it is still possible to get a "pacifist" ending. How? By not engaging in any fight! This walkthrough will guide you through the Ignoramus route. The only requirement is to not get into any battle.

You will be able to start the route when meeting Flowey. When trying to leave immediately, Flowey will taunt you, telling you that Ignoramus won't be so easy.
