While there is no way to spare enemies in Undertale 2, it is still possible to get a "pacifist" ending. How? By not engaging in any fight! This walkthrough will guide you through the Ignoramus route. The only requirement is to not get into any battle.

You will be able to start the route when meeting Flowey. If you choose to go past Flowey and leave without fighting, you will be held back. Flowey hints at a possible solution to ignore the fight.
