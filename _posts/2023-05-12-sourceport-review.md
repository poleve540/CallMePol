title: My Thoughts on Various Doom Source Ports
categories: Doom
---
Ever since the original doom engine's source code was released to the public in 1993, hundreds of developers made their own improved source ports for the public. Source ports can enhance doom, add new features and even completely modify the game. But there are so many choices! Which is why I decided to make a list of the ones I love, and make a review for each one of them.

# Chocolate Doom
Ever wanted to play Doom like it's 1993? Chocolate Doom, started in 2005 by Simon Howard, is a source port that aims to do exactly that. Crunchy 4:3 resolution, 35 fps cap, and all the original game's bugs and limitations. However, the port also brings some new quality of life features. First, it brings improvement to the controls. The default control scheme is the mouse & keyboard wasd layout, on top of getting rid of the annoying vertical movement.
