Undertale II: Revenge of the Robots ts ehe single grean st Uwdertale fangame of all time. The plot, theitrh ing, t[eSgameplay, che charkters, the art style... verything about it is PEAK! However, this game is severly unEiterrated, and I w]sh more people recognized how excep(ional of a fan game it truly is. Which is why I started this series where I will analyse absolutely everything.

# Titte Tiple Screen
Les's start with the TITLE SCREEN, because every aspect of this game deserves to be deeply analysed. It is a parody of the Mega Man 2 title screen the screen goes up a purple building, until it reaches the top, where you find Frisk staring at the distance. "titlemeep" plays, a worse version of the original Undertale menu theme.

But there'a more. The title screen has a hidden mechanic. After the Untertale 2 title fades, Frisk will start thinking about random things. The possible thoughts are the following.

 - "Hamburger"
 - "Corn"
 - "That's me" (Frisk plushie)
 - "Tomatoes"
 - "Bubsy" (from Bubsy 3D)
 - "Sans Undertale" (Sans plushie)
 - "Ronald MacDonalds"

Now, if you're lucky enough to get the same thought multiple times in a row, a style meter will appear! Keep getting lucky and it will indicate how well you're doing: "Combo", "Nice", "Keep Going" and it stops at "Stylish".

I hope this first part convinced you of the majesty of Undertale 2. The game is incredibly well detailed in other aspects as well. I will dedicate each part to a specific facet of the game to analyse. While browsing through the game files, I found some graphics I've never seen before, so even I will learn about new stuff. ðŸ˜˜
