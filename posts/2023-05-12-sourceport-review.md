title: My Thoughts on Various Doom Source Ports
categories: Doom
---
Ever since the original doom engine's source code was released to the public in 1993, hundreds of developers made their own improved source ports for the public. Source ports can enhance doom, add new features and even completely modify the game. But there are so many choices! Which is why I decided to make a list of the ones I love, and make a review for each one of them.

# Chocolate Doom (add choco logo)
Ever wanted to play Doom like it's 1993? Chocolate Doom, started in 2005 by Simon Howard, is a source port that aims to do exactly that.

Crunchy 4:3 resolution, 35 fps cap, and all the original game's bugs and limitations: Chocolate Doom is essentially indistinguishable from the vanilla executable. It is one of the most accurate source ports out there.

Despite the port's conservative nature, it still brings some new quality of life features. A modern control scheme is available, getting rid the annoying vertical mouse movement. Controller support. Fullscreen support for higher resolutions, while still keeping the 320x200 look. High quality soundtrack support. And finally, an easy to use command line interface.

Chocolate doom is your source port of choice if you are looking for a true vanilla experience. It's extremely lightweight nature also makes it great for portability, and low spec machines.

# Crispy Doom (add Crispy logo)
Based on Chocolate Doom, Crispy Doom removes the original game's limitations and adds many new features.

The biggest feature is the new 640x400 resolution, giving the game a "Crispy" look. It also has widescreen support and uncapped framerate.

New gameplay features are available, such as jumping and a limited freelook. There are many compatibility settings to change how the game behaves, like disabling infinite monster height.

But my favourite thing has to be the small details added to the game. Differently colored blood for monsters such as cacodemons and hell knights. Randomly mirrored corpses. Translucency on spectres. Better colored automap. Notifications when finding secrets.

It is my source port of choice for vanilla doom, since setting it up for play is easier and faster than some other more advanced source ports. Though I wish it had Boom and MBF support.
